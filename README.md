# AB0403-project
The project attempt my team submitted for semester 2 AY2021/2022.

Code was done on Python 3+.  
The project required us to attempt to create a user interface in Python that helped to promote sustainability.  
My group hence created an energy consumption tracking tool to track and promote the benefits of saving energy.  

The parts that I helped with included creating a password system and information storing system using .csv files, as well as creating the main menu interface.
